       "array(['\"Secret Sunshine\" reminded me of \"The Rapture\" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better film. It portrays super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, and the main character\\'s experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang (\\'Secret Sunshine\\' in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son. She has chosen Milyang because her late husband (killed in an auto accident) was born there, and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place. She does not react well to the overtures of the local Christian zealots, one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can. In fact, she brushes just about everyone in Milyang off to begin with, but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more would be to give the film away, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is stupendous. Having read that she won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2007, I expected her to a decent job. But Ms. Jeon is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen. The movie is a sort of harrowing Evelyn Waugh-esquire piece of work, showing how Fate can feel insane as much as strangely inevitable.',\n",

       "       'Bogdonovich\\'s (mostly) unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other. A film that has the feel of a fairy tale, but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic Manhattan locations and \"true\" geography, perhaps the best location filming in NYC I\\'ve ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be brilliant, and the entire ensemble is a group you\\'ll wish truly existed so you could spend time with `em. One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn\\'t seem to be a rip-off of something else, this is the high point of Bogdanovich\\'s fertile after- \"success\" career, when his best work was truly done (\"saint jack\", \"at long last...\", \"noises off\".',\n",

Alida is one of the grand old ladies in european movie history. I loved her maniacal looks in \"Suspiria\" and \"inferno\" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time dealing with this movie.

       "       'H.G. Cluozot had difficulties working in France after he had made \"Le Corbeau\" in 1943 which was produced by the German company and later judged by French as a piece of anti-French propaganda. Louis Jouvet, an admirer of Clouzot\\'s work, invited him to direct a thriller \"Quai des Orfevres\" where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating a murder that happened in Paris Music Hall. Without each other knowledge, the seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her jealous piano-accompanist husband Maurice who is madly in love with her (Bertrand Blier, father of director Bertrand Blier) trying to cover up (without each other\\'s knowledge) what they believe to be their involvement in the murder? Enters tenacious policeman (Louis Jouvet) who is determined to discover the truth. Jouvet practically stole the movie with wonderfully cynic and sentimental in the same time performance. \"His character, his eagle-like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable.\" \"Quai des Orfevres\", witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great comeback of H.G. Cluozot, the fine director, \"French Hitchcock\".'],\n",
